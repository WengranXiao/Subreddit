# Subreddit_Recommendation_System
This is a full-stack project for SI507 final. It is a website with a recommendation system that can recommend the most appropriate subreddits related to COVID to users. Users only have to answer three questions regarding what type of subreddits they want. The purpose of this project is to provide users with a convinient way to get information and news related to covid-19, vaccination, anti-convid medicine, etc. I hope this website will facilitate citizens' daily life during the pandemic.
## Guidance for using the peoject:
Requiered packages: flask, requests, json, time, bs4
Private keys are not committed to Github. I have uploaded the secretkey.py into Canvas.
